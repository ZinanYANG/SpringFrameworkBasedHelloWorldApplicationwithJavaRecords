# SpringFrameworkBasedHelloWorldApplicationwithJavaRecords
Developed a HelloWorld application using Java (JDK 17) and Spring Framework, showcasing the use of Java records for data representation and Spring Beans for dependency management.



<p>Technology Stack: Java 17, Spring Framework (Spring Beans, Spring Context), Eclipse IDE.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java Records Implementation: Utilized Java records (Person and Address) to model immutable data structures, demonstrating modern Java features for concise and readable code.
</li>
  <li>Spring Beans Configuration: Defined multiple Spring Beans in HelloWorldConfiguration class, including beans for primitive types (String, int), complex types (Person, Address), and method-based bean creation.
</li>
  <li>Dependency Injection and Management: Demonstrated Spring's dependency injection capabilities by configuring and retrieving beans in the application context, highlighting skills in managing application dependencies.
</li>
  <li>Primary Bean Annotation: Used @Primary annotation to resolve conflicts when multiple beans of the same type are defined, showcasing understanding of advanced Spring features.
</li>
  <li>Annotation-Based Configuration: Employed AnnotationConfigApplicationContext for managing the Spring context, emphasizing annotation-based configuration in Spring.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning Outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Gained practical experience in using Java records, a feature introduced in recent Java versions, for efficient data modeling.
</li>
  <li>Enhanced understanding of Spring Framework, particularly in bean configuration, dependency management, and application context handling.
</li>
  <li>Developed skills in writing modern Java applications using Spring, focusing on clean code practices and efficient configuration management.
</li>
</ul>
